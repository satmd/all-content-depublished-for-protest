# all-content-depublished-for-protest

I have removed all my content on github because
- it's now owned by microsoft
- copilot, AI and parasiting on other people's content everywhere
- their chairman believes that 90s' content is "public domain" for anyone to
  use in any way.[1]
- microsoft is not getting security right [2]
- they want to force us to their xoauth2 for their mail service [3]
- They force garbage on me (including nagging for onedrive, o365, windows
  preloaded with ads and "popular games" and sponsored content - while I have
  actually paid for the product
- They handle me like their ware or product, not like a customer
- They are still trying to cause monopolistic dependencies (Edge, Tracking)
- Their OS is not operatable in accordance to EU-GDPR law (You cannot
  configure it as a private person to conform to the law)
- They want to (partially) blame EU lawmakers for the CrowdStrike fiasco[4]

[3] If it's about reducing spam... I only care for receiving mail... with a
    not so mainstream client, without a browser and ... heck ... without JS
    cookies and all that modern garbage that's technically not needed at all
